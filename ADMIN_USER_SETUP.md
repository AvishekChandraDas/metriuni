# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Create Admin User for Production

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Problem:**

The admin user doesn't exist in the production database, causing login to fail.

## âœ… **Quick Solution:**

### **Step 1: Register a temporary admin account**

1. **Go to**: https://wondrous-souffle-ff83f7.netlify.app/register
2. **Fill the form with these EXACT details**:
   ```
   Name: Admin User
   Email: admin@metro.edu
   Password: admin123
   Confirm Password: admin123
   Student ID: 232-115-001
   Department: Administration
   Batch: 2020
   Phone: (optional)
   Address: (optional)
   Date of Birth: (optional)
   ID Card Photo: (skip for now)
   ```
3. **Submit the registration**
4. **You'll see**: "Registration submitted successfully. Please wait for admin approval."

### **Step 2: Manually approve via database or API**

Since we can't auto-approve, I'll help you create a quick endpoint to manually set the user as admin.

### **Step 3: Alternative - Use a temporary super-admin endpoint**

Let me create an emergency endpoint that bypasses validation...

   {
     "role": "admin",
     "status": "approved"
   }
