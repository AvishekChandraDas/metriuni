   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS question_votes;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS answers;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS questions;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS files;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS study_group_members;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS study_groups;
   ```

2. **Documentation Update**: Update main README.md if needed to reflect the simplified feature set

3. **Testing**: Test the remaining features to ensure no dependencies were broken

## Technical Notes

- All route handlers and API endpoints for removed features have been cleanly removed
- No broken imports or references remain in the codebase
- The application builds and runs successfully without the removed features
- Navigation has been simplified to focus on core social networking functionality
- Database migrations for removed features are no longer executed during setup

## Impact Assessment

The MetroUni platform is now streamlined to focus on its core social networking capabilities while maintaining all the essential features for student and faculty interaction.
