# Combined Feed Search Implementation - COMPLETE

## üéØ Task Summary

Enhanced the MetroUni feed search functionality to return both matching posts and users, with manual search only (no auto-search). Users can search by pressing Enter or clicking the search button.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

### Backend Changes

1. **Updated `/api/posts` route** (`backend/routes/posts.js`)

   - Added support for searching both posts and users when query parameter `q` is provided
   - Returns response with both `posts` and `users` arrays in search mode
   - Uses existing `User.search()` method to find matching users by name, email, or department

2. **User Search Method** (`backend/models/User.js`)
   - Already implemented `User.search()` method for finding users by name, email, or department

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Types** (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`)

   - Added `FeedResponse` type with both posts and users arrays
   - Updated User and Post types to support the combined response

2. **Created Reusable UserCard Component** (`frontend/src/components/UserCard.tsx`)

   - Extracted from DiscoverPage for reuse in FeedPage
   - Includes follow/unfollow functionality
   - Supports click navigation to user profiles
   - Shows user avatar, name, email, department, batch, and bio
   - Displays verification and teacher badges

3. **Updated DiscoverPage** (`frontend/src/pages/DiscoverPage.tsx`)

   - Refactored to use the new reusable UserCard component
   - Removed inline UserCard definition

4. **Enhanced FeedPage** (`frontend/src/pages/FeedPage.tsx`)

   - **Manual Search Only**: Removed debounced auto-search, search only triggers on Enter key or search button click
   - **Combined Results**: Displays both user and post search results in separate sections
   - **Search UI**: Added search button, Enter key support, and clear (X) button
   - **Results Display**:
     - "People" section showing user results with UserCard components
     - "Posts" section showing post results with PostCard components
     - Combined search results indicator showing counts of both
   - **State Management**: Properly handles and clears both posts and users arrays
   - **Navigation**: Disabled pagination during search mode

5. **API Service** (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
   - Already configured to handle the FeedResponse type from backend

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Search Interface

- Search input with placeholder: "Type to search posts, then press Enter or click Search button..."
- Search button with search icon
- Clear button (X) when there's text in the search input
- Search results indicator showing: "Found X post(s) and Y user(s) for 'query'"

### Search Results Display

- **People Section**:
  - Header with user icon and count
  - UserCard components with follow/unfollow buttons
  - Click to navigate to user profiles
- **Posts Section**:
  - Header with posts icon and count
  - PostCard components with full functionality
- **No Results**: Proper messaging when no posts or users found
- **Clear Search**: Button to return to regular feed

### Regular Feed

- Unchanged functionality when not searching
- Load more pagination (disabled during search)
- Create post functionality

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Search Flow

1. User types in search input
2. User presses Enter or clicks search button
3. Frontend calls `/api/posts?q=searchTerm`
4. Backend searches both posts and users
5. Frontend displays results in separate sections
6. User can clear search to return to regular feed

### State Management

```typescript
const [posts, setPosts] = useState<Post[]>([]);
const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
const [activeSearchQuery, setActiveSearchQuery] = useState("");
```

### API Response Format

```typescript
interface FeedResponse {
  posts: Post[];
  users?: User[];
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
    hasMore: boolean;
  };
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Frontend Testing

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Log in to the application
3. Go to Feed page
4. Test search functionality:
   - Type search terms and press Enter
   - Click search button
   - Verify both user and post results appear
   - Test follow/unfollow on user cards
   - Test navigation to user profiles
   - Test clear search functionality

### Backend Testing

- The backend endpoints require authentication
- Use the frontend interface for complete testing
- API returns proper combined results structure

## üìÅ Files Modified/Created

### Created

- `frontend/src/components/UserCard.tsx` - Reusable user card component

### Modified

- `backend/routes/posts.js` - Added user search to posts endpoint
- `frontend/src/pages/FeedPage.tsx` - Enhanced with combined search
- `frontend/src/pages/DiscoverPage.tsx` - Refactored to use UserCard component
- `frontend/src/types/index.ts` - Added FeedResponse type

### Documentation

- `test-combined-search.sh` - Test script for the implementation

## üéâ Result

The feed search now successfully:

- ‚úÖ Returns both posts and users in search results
- ‚úÖ Uses manual search only (no auto-search)
- ‚úÖ Displays users with follow/unfollow functionality
- ‚úÖ Displays posts with full functionality
- ‚úÖ Provides clear search results indicators
- ‚úÖ Maintains separation between search and regular feed
- ‚úÖ Allows easy clearing of search results

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
