## 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

### MongoDB Configuration

```javascript
// Current connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/metriuni

// Production (MongoDB Atlas)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/metriuni
```

### Key Model Features

- **Mongoose ODM**: All models use Mongoose for schema validation
- **Indexing**: Proper indexes for performance optimization
- **Relationships**: Proper ObjectId references between models
- **Validation**: Built-in validation for data integrity
- **Soft Deletes**: Status-based soft deletion system

### Performance Optimizations

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Proper pagination for large datasets
- Optimized queries with population
- Connection pooling handled by Mongoose

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS PRIORITY

1. **High Priority**: Migrate remaining models (Answer, Question, Notification)
2. **Medium Priority**: Test all API endpoints and fix any issues
3. **Medium Priority**: Set up MongoDB Atlas for production
4. **Low Priority**: Create deployment scripts and monitoring

## 📞 READY FOR NEXT PHASE
