# 🚀 URGENT: Fix Frontend Routing Issue

## 🎯 **The Problem:**

Netlify doesn't know how to handle React Router routes like `/feed`, `/admin`, etc.
It tries to find them as actual files and returns 404.

## ✅ **The Solution:**

Added `_redirects` file that tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes,
allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

## 📦 **Deploy Fixed Frontend:**

### **Option 1: Drag & Drop (Fastest)**

1. **Finder window opened** to: `/frontend/dist` folder
2. **Go to Netlify**: https://app.netlify.com/sites/wondrous-souffle-ff83f7/overview
3. **Drag the entire `dist` folder** onto the Netlify deploy area
4. **Wait for deployment** (30-60 seconds)

### **Option 2: Command Line**

```bash
cd /Users/avishekchandradas/Desktop/MetroUni/frontend
npx netlify-cli deploy --prod --dir dist
```

## 🧪 **After Deployment - Test These:**

1. **Direct URL test**: https://wondrous-souffle-ff83f7.netlify.app/feed
2. **Admin test**: https://wondrous-souffle-ff83f7.netlify.app/admin
3. **Login flow**: Login → Should redirect to /feed properly
4. **Refresh test**: Go to /feed and refresh page (should work now)

## 🎉 **Expected Results:**

- ✅ No more "Page not found" errors
- ✅ Direct navigation to `/feed`, `/admin` works
- ✅ Browser refresh on any route works
- ✅ Back/forward buttons work
- ✅ Login redirects work properly

## 📁 **What the `_redirects` file does:**

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This tells Netlify: "For ANY route (\*), serve index.html with 200 status"

React Router then takes over and handles the client-side routing.

**🚨 DEPLOY NOW:** The dist folder is ready - just drag it to Netlify!
